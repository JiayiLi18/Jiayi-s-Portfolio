                <p>In a cruel and changing nature, how do creatures struggle to survive and evolve? This game tries to
                    combine
                    the overall biological evolution with individual sensory activities: players use VR with wearable
                    devices we
                    designed to simulate the behaviour of multiple creatures, evolving to survive through feeding,
                    reproducing,
                    and avoiding natural enemies, condensing hundreds of millions of years of the evolutionary path into one
                    game of ten minutes.</p>

                    <h4>Goals of the game</h4>
                    <p>Since invertebrates are the most distant branch of animals from humans in the evolutionary tree, their
                        perception is extremely different from all aspects. Therefore many interesting results will arise when
                        humans try to understand the feelings of invertebrates.<br>
                        The senses are our intuitive way of perceiving the world. If we can feel the invertebrate type of
                        senses, we
                        may be able to reconstruct a different reality through empathy on feelings.</p>

                    <h4>Survival and Evolution</h4>
                    <p>You are an invertebrate life born on the primitive earth, starting your life in the dark. You struggle to
                        survive
                        and reproduce in an unknown environment, avoiding natural enemies and natural disasters, to get the
                        opportunity
                        to evolve.
                        You represent a species, your second is thousands of years in the game. You may be able to survive
                        several
                        epochs, evolve into a new form, or you will be in a brutal struggle for survival in extinction.
                        In the end, you will get your unique evolution map and image, showing the path of invertebrate evolution
                        that only belongs to you.</p>

                    <p>In order to create a rich ecological environment, the game will randomly generate three types of
                        creatures:
                        Predator, Prey and your same species.</p>
                    <h4>Predator</h4>
                    <p>Predators will track players within a certain range and players can escape by hiding or accelerating. If
                        you
                        are
                        preyed upon by predators, you will lose a large amount of population.</p>
                    <h4>Congener</h4>
                    <p>Congener can be mated, but the player must first attract them by blowing air to release pheromones. A
                        large
                        population can be obtained by reproducing.</p>
                    <h4>Prey</h4>
                    <p>The player must maintain the hunger bar by accelerating close to prey and opening his/her mouth to eat.
                        Eating
                        the prey will give you a small population gain.</p>
