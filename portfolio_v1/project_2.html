                <p>Play the xylophone and launch a resonant particle
                    into the universe — a game of music and meditation.<br>
                    The artwork consists of a round xylophone with a built-in Arduino board to detect knocking signals and a
                    digital rhythm game as the digital feedback and instrument guide. Originally inspired by the Himalayan
                    singing bowl,
                    the installation wants to create a harmonious and ethereal atmosphere by playing the instrument through
                    the guide of the rhythm game.</p>

                <h4>Goals of the game</h4>
                <p>Since invertebrates are the most distant branch of animals from humans in the evolutionary tree, their
                    perception is extremely different from all aspects. Therefore many interesting results will arise when
                    humans try to understand the feelings of invertebrates.<br>
                    The senses are our intuitive way of perceiving the world. If we can feel the invertebrate type of
                    senses, we
                    may be able to reconstruct a different reality through empathy on feelings.</p>

                <h4>Survival and Evolution</h4>
                <img src="project_2/screenshot(3).jpg" alt="image">
                <p>You are an invertebrate life born on the primitive earth, starting your life in the dark. You struggle to
                    survive
                    and reproduce in an unknown environment, avoiding natural enemies and natural disasters, to get the
                    opportunity
                    to evolve.
                    You represent a species, your second is thousands of years in the game. You may be able to survive
                    several
                    epochs, evolve into a new form, or you will be in a brutal struggle for survival in extinction.
                    In the end, you will get your unique evolution map and image, showing the path of invertebrate evolution
                    that only belongs to you.</p>
