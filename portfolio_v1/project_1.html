            <p>In a cruel and changing nature, how do creatures struggle to survive and evolve? This game tries to combine
                the overall biological evolution with individual sensory activities: players use VR with wearable devices we
                designed to simulate the behaviour of multiple creatures, evolving to survive through feeding, reproducing,
                and avoiding natural enemies, condensing hundreds of millions of years of the evolutionary path into one
                game of ten minutes.</p>

            <h4>Goals of the game</h4>
            <p>Since invertebrates are the most distant branch of animals from humans in the evolutionary tree, their
                perception is extremely different from all aspects. Therefore many interesting results will arise when
                humans try to understand the feelings of invertebrates.<br>
                The senses are our intuitive way of perceiving the world. If we can feel the invertebrate type of senses, we
                may be able to reconstruct a different reality through empathy on feelings.</p>

            <img src="project_1/screenshot2.jpg" alt="screenshot2">
            <p>You are an invertebrate life born on the primitive earth, starting your life in the dark. You struggle to
                survive
                and reproduce in an unknown environment, avoiding natural enemies and natural disasters, to get the
                opportunity
                to evolve.
                You represent a species, your second is thousands of years in the game. You may be able to survive several
                epochs, evolve into a new form, or you will be in a brutal struggle for survival in extinction.
                In the end, you will get your unique evolution map and image, showing the path of invertebrate evolution
                that only belongs to you.</p>

            <p>In order to create a rich ecological environment, the game will randomly generate three types of creatures:
                Predator, Prey and your same species.</p>
            <h4>Predator</h4>
            <p>Predators will track players within a certain range and players can escape by hiding or accelerating. If you
                are
                preyed upon by predators, you will lose a large amount of population.</p>
            <h4>Congener</h4>
            <p>Congener can be mated, but the player must first attract them by blowing air to release pheromones. A large
                population can be obtained by reproducing.</p>
            <h4>Prey</h4>
            <p>The player must maintain the hunger bar by accelerating close to prey and opening his/her mouth to eat.
                Eating
                the prey will give you a small population gain.</p>
